# Skill Scope

Skill Scope is a Streamlit-based application designed to analyze job market trends in Romania across various categories. This project scrapes job data from LinkedIn, processes it, and visualizes key insights, such as top technologies and tools, education levels, experience distribution etc. The project also includes a dashboard to interactively explore these trends.

In my exploration, I noticed that job postings often required proficiency in a multitude of technologies. To streamline my own decision-making process, I created an interface that aggregates and displays this information in a centralized manner.

**Note:** 
The data for this project was scraped on June 24, 2024. Please be aware that job market trends can change rapidly, and the insights presented in this app might become less relevant over time.
